# Firebase_Train_Scheduler

In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. It retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## The Train Scheduler allows users to add trains and submit the following:
 -Train Name
 -Destination 
 -First Train Time -- in military time
 -Frequency -- in minutes
 -App calculates when the next train will arrive; relative to the current time.
 -Users from many different machines can all view same train times.
